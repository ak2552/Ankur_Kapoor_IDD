### Paper Puppets
A lab report by Ankur Kapoor

In this Report
To submit your lab, clone this repository. You'll need to describe your design, include a video of your paper display in operation, and upload any code you wrote to make it move.

### Part A. Actuating DC motors

### Part B. Actuating Servo motors

## Part 1. Connect the Servo to your breadboard
a. Which color wires correspond to power, ground and signal?
Brown Wire : Ground
Red Wire : Power
Orange Wire : Signal

## Part 2. Connect the Servo to your Arduino

# a. Which Arduino pin should the signal line of the servo be attached to?

Digital Pin 9

# b. What aspects of the Servo code control angle or speed?

The angle is controlled by the part of the code where pos = 0; pos <= 180; pos += 1and to corresponding part pos = 180; pos >= 0; pos -= 1. There is two ways to change the speed. We can simply change a) the delay(1); function b) we can change the position increments: pos += 1

### Part C. Integrating input and output
