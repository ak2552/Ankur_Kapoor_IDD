For your write up, include:

1) Your Arduino code.

3) At least one photo of your box taken in the MakerLab's Portable Photo Studio (or somewhere else, but of similar quality).
The lighting in MakerLab's Portable Photo Studio doesn't work, so the picture is a bit dark...

4) A video of your box in action.
